## Get started

Here I only show how to use the app in your browser. For a more detailed description
and ways to deploy the app on a website seek the original repo.


```bash
# cd into this directory
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
